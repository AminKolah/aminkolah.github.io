I’m a computational engineer and scientific software developer passionate about creating innovative solutions to complex challenges in engineering and science. With a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering and years of experience, I specialize in developing 
advanced, scalable coding frameworks for multiphase flow and computational fluid-structure interaction models.

My strong, multidisciplinary foundation in STEM has driven solution-oriented strategies across diverse applications, 
resulting in several publications in top-tier engineering, applied mathematics, and applied physics journals, as well as numerous presentations at key conferences.

I’m driven by the opportunity to design and apply computational science and applied mathematics tools to real-world problems, collaborating with others to tackle tough challenges. Along the way, I take joy in moments when engineering 
innovation and creative expression align to create impactful solutions. 

Beyond my technical work, I find deep inspiration in the natural world and the intricate systems that govern it.
